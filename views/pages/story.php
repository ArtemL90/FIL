                            Noyaki is a millennium old tradition in Aso to preserve the grasslands. 
                            The landscape of Aso grasslands is a symbol of the human relationship with nature. 
                            Locals have been maintaining and using the grasslands to undertake sustainable farming 
                            and agriculture in volcanic lands.

                            Without Noyaki, Aso grasslands would become overgrown with bushes and 
                            the biodiversity native to Aso will be at risk. Noyaki exterminates destructive 
                            insects and helps new shoots on their upward journey above ground. 
                            Aso’s stunning landscape and rich habitats exist in partnership between humans and nature."

                            Noyaki takes place here in Minami-Oguni town, where FIL is based and with the 
                            FIL staff partaking. We feel it is important to experience the tradition and 
                            continue to reflect on what it means to live with nature. 
                            We also value fostering relationships with local communities and commit to 
                            treasure this nature for our next generation and thereafter.
